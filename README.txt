photofocus
==========

This android application is the prototype for Photo Focus, a mobile application that aims to help amateur photographers improve their skills, find cool or trendy
nearby places to take pictures, and aid in storing weather and location information for pictures.

Photo Focus has a backend server that stores photos, comments, and notes for our users. Because this is a prototype, currently, there is no direct link to flickr, 500px,
or other social photography communities. Likewise, tracking and storing of weather and locational information is not yet implemented. However, user information and photos
are loaded from the server.

Photo Focus was made during a cs160, User Design, Course at UC Berkeley.

To run, first load this project in android eclipse.
To be able to compile the project, you must install the Google Maps package and api. This is quite tedious and requires registering with google online.
Please go here for more information: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/

Once the project is loaded, do a project clean to make sure eclipse generates the right files appropriately.
Then, open any .java file and run the project as onto a galaxy nexus; the maps and true functionalities do not work on emulator.
Note: this app is designed for the galaxy nexus and thus, may not scale well for other sized android devices.

Run and enjoy!
