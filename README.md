photofocus
==========

This android application is the prototype for Photo Focus, a mobile application that aims to help amateur photographers improve their skills, find cool or trendy
nearby places to take pictures, and aid in storing weather and location information for pictures.

Photo Focus has a backend server that stores photos, comments, and notes for our users. Because this is a prototype, currently, there is no direct link to flickr, 500px,
or other social photography communities. Likewise, tracking and storing of weather and locational information is not yet implemented. However, user information and photos
are loaded from the server.

Photo Focus was made during a cs160, User Design, Course at UC Berkeley.
